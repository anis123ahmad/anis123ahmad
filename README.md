- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web Development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on Custom WooCommerce Payment Plugins ...

I am a PHP and custom woocommerce payment plugin developer. I also have a good hand in MySQL, Ajax, JS, Jquery, HTML5 and CSS3.

Recently I developed a Custom Woocommerce Payment plugin for Woocommerce with 3DS2 authentication for First Atlantic Commerce (FAC) Payment Plugin 3DS2.
