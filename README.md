- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @anis123ahmad
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web Development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on Custom WooCommerce Payment Plugins using 3rd Party Payment API.

I am a PHP and custom WooCommerce Payment Plugin Developer. I also have a good hand in MySQL, Ajax, JS, Jquery, REST API Integration, HTML5 and CSS3.

Recently I developed a Custom Woocommerce Payment plugin for Woocommerce with 3DS2 authentication for First Atlantic Commerce (FAC) Payment Plugin 3DS2.

This FAC Payment Gateway works in Caribbean countries.
This WoocCmmerce plugin uses the latest FAC PowerTranz REST API for 3DS2 authentication. It uses the Direct Method on the WooCommerce Checkout page using an iframe on the checkout page.
You can request a demo.

Some WooCommerce Payment Plugins Developed by Me:

- FAC Payment Gateway using the 3DS2 feature
- Elavon Converge with 3DS feature Hosted Payment Page (HPP) method
- WooCommerce Gateway using Direct Method for ARB Bank KSA
- WooCommerce Subscription Payment Plugin using SEPA (VR Payment API works in Germany) Direct Debit using IBAN
- WooCommerce Subscription (Instalment) Payment Plugin using SEPA (GoCardless API) Direct Debit using IBAN
- WorldPay WooCommerce Payment Plugin using Hosted Payment Page (HPP) method
- Elavon Converge using XML API Direct Payment method ( Customer will pay on your store's checkout page, no need to redirect )
